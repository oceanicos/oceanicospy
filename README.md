This is a python library used to centralize and re-use all the code that has been generated by all the different members in OCEANICOS research group. This package include scripts:

- to read most of the data recorded by the available oceanogrpahic devices
- to analyze different types of data using temporal and spectral techniques
- to automatize most of the preprocessing tasks in the numerical modelling with models such as: SWAN, WW3 and XBeach
- to obtain typical but useful quick plots of certain variables.
- to retrieve automatically data from different data sources such as reanalysis, real-time data, etc.

This is a purely collaborative work as it is intended to facilitate a lot of processes in our everyday research activities
