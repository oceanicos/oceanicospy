Walkthrough Example
======================

This document provides a walkthrough of how to use the `oceanicospy` package to handle observations from various sensors.

First, ensure you have the package installed. You can install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install oceanicospy

Next, you can import the necessary classes from the `oceanicospy.observations` module. For example, if you want to work with the AQUAlogger sensor, you can do so as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from oceanicospy.observations import AQUAlogger
