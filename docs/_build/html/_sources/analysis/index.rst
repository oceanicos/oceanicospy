Analysis
============

Most of the time series recorded with the available devices need to be analyzed using signal processing techniques.
This section provides a set of tools to perform different types of methods such as Fourier analysis,
Hilbert and wavelet transforms, and Empirical Mode Decomposiction (EMD). These methods are useful not only for wind-wave analysis,
but also for other types of waves like infragravity waves (IG).

This section also includes tools for spectral analysis like filtering, windowing and spectral density estimation.
